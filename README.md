To test the GitHub app, follow these steps:

1. Add the app to your profile and grant access to a specific repo.
   - App URL: [AnakinApp](https://github.com/apps/anakinapp)

2. Raise a new PR or comment on an existing PR review.

3. Include the command `'/explain'` in the comment.

4. The app will generate an explanation in response.
   - Note: Currently, the app only responds to the '/explain' command in PR review comments.
